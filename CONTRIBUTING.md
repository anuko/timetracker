# Setting up a Dev Environment

Docker users: install both docker and docker-compose, then run a dev instance:
```bash
cp conf/config.php src/WEB-INF/config.php
docker-compose up
```
Navigate to: http://localhost:8080 to use Time Tracker. Default credentials for initial login are:
```
usr: admin

```

Without docker, perform a manual install of a web server, php, database server, and Time Tracker. Full installation and setup guide can be found [here](https://www.anuko.com/time_tracker/install_guide/index.htm).
